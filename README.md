## 🎯 Project Overview

This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on e-commerce purchase data to uncover actionable business insights. Through systematic analysis of customer demographics, payment methods, and purchasing patterns, the project delivers data-driven recommendations for marketing optimization and customer retention strategies.

### Business Objectives

- Identify customer segmentation opportunities based on demographics
- Analyze payment method preferences and credit card expiration trends
- Discover temporal purchasing patterns (AM vs PM)
- Extract insights from email provider and language distributions
- Provide strategic recommendations for marketing and operations teams
